# [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

when you want to contribute to someone else's project, or leverage their project as a starting point for your own  
a *fork* is a personal copy of someone else's project  
you can submit pull requests to offer your changes up to the original project ('social coding')  
click the **Fork** button in the repository header (by **Watch** and **Star**)  
clone it to your computer by hitting the clone/download button and open in GitHub Desktop  
make changes to the project files by using a text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io/))  
when ready to submit, *stage* and *commit* your changes, then *push* them to the remote  
after pushing, navigate to the repository on <github.com>, and it will indicate you can compare and submit a pull request to the original project  
add a title and description providing the rationale behind your pull request, and then it's up to the maintainer if they would like to implement or not
