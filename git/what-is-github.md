# [What is GitHub?](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E)  
platform that helps people build software by working together  
*branches* to the code create an 'alternate timeline' where you can make changes to the code without disrupting the current existing software  
GitHub tracks changes (*commits*) and saves snapshots of progress  
once you're ready to collaborate with the rest of the team, open a *pull request* to share the changes you're proposing, then review and discuss them  
then once everybody has signed off on the changes, the new code can be incorporated into the project by *merging* the pull request into the `main` branch  
as soon as it is merged, it is immediately available to all users
