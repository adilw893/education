## Books
- [ ] **The Markdown Guide - Matt Cone (PDF)**  
  
[companion site](https://www.markdownguide.org/) included in [links](../markdown#links) below  
created by [John Gruber]((https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) in 2004, WYSIWYG editor (what you see is what you get)  
1. create file with a `.md` or `.markdown` extension  
2. open file in a Markdown app  
3. convert Markdown file to an HTML document  
4. view HTML file in a web browser or use app to convert to another file format (like PDF)  
  
[Markdown Cheat Sheet](../markdown/markdown-cheat-sheet.md)  
can still use HTML tags within Markdown documents  
headings created by one to six `#` in front of heading text  
paragraph breaks created with a blank line in betweeen blocks of text  
line breaks created by adding 2+ spaces to end of a line ('trailing whitespace')  
another option for line breaks is to use the HTML break tag `<br>` <br>
*italics* are wrapped with single `*` or `_`  
**bold** is wrapped with double `**` or `__`  
***bold and italics*** use three `***` or `___` (or combinations thereof)  
> blockquotes are made with `>`  
> they can span multiple lines and paragraphs  
>> they can also be nested  
>> and they support *some* Markdown formatting  
1. ordered lists use numbers with periods, e.g., `1.`  
6. the first one has to start with 1, but otherwise they don't need to be in order  
  1. and they can be nested too  
* unordered lists are made with `*`, `+`, or `-`  
  - and of course support nesting  
`inline code` is made using tick marks  
``and you escape `tick marks in code` with double ticks``  
triple ticks allow for a code block like this:  
```
# this is my code
hw <- 'hello world'
print(hw)
```
horizontal rules are made of a separate line with just three `---`, `___`, or `***`  
inline-style links are `[text enclosed in brackets](url 'optional title')`  
a quick link uses angle brackets `<url>`  
reference-style links are broken into two parts:  
* in paragraph: `[text to display][link reference]`  
* anywhere else in your document: `[link reference]: url`  
* generally placed at end (like footnotes)
images are added just like links, except with a `!` in front of the `[bracketed text (which becomes the caption)]`  
use a backslash `\` in front of a Markdown formatting character to escape it and display it literally
